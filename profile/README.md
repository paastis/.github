## ‚òÅÔ∏è WTF is PaaS ?!

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet.
Usually, these tools are needed for application development. 
A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. 
As a result, PaaS frees developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.
